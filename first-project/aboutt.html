							<h3>My University Life</h3>
							<p>I found it relatively easy to decide which course to do, it was where to go which I found harder to decide. As good as a course might be, I think it is equally important to live in a town or a city which you can relate to.</p>

							<p>I'm in my second year, so I share a house with friends. It was difficult at first, what with doing your own washing, ironing and cooking, but you soon get used to it. Last year I would just eat chips and beans and spend the rest of my money on beer, but this year I'm trying to cut down on the chips and beans and eat a bit more healthily.</p>
